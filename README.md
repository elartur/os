CONSOLE OS


Objective:
	The aim of this project is to facilitate the upcoming Raspberry Pi’s with game-based console OS through a 64-bit custom operating system. The system will include a compiler, bootloader, kernel, graphics library, an assembler, pre-installed firmware, and a simple game for testing purposes. C++ has been chosen  as the programming language because it’s lightweight, has great support, and can execute on many microcontrollers with varying processors . 

Requirements:
	Rpi B
	Controller
	Monitor
	Peripherals
